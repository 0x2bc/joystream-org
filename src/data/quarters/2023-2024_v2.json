For both of these reasons we are working on introducing a proper in-app on/off ramp for consumers and creators of an Atlas app. There are many great ramp partners, such as Transak, which have robust low-friction buy/sell widgets for crypto using credit cards, Apple/Google pay, from across a large number of jurisdictions."
