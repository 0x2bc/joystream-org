        Our brand identity consists of few key visual elements: our logo, typeface, illustrations, patter, colour palette
        and iconography.

        <p>
          Each of these elements has a meaningful role in brand identity as established in the guidelines. But combining all of
          these components builds much more than just a visual experience.

        <p>
          Joystream branding is a powerful tool for communication with all of its users throughout their whole experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fundamentally, our effort is an experimental one; we do not have all the answers, and we want to be honest
          about that in our communication.

          We are not promising cheaper, faster or nicer, like one typically would when selling a consumer widget or
          service. Instead we have hope that we can build something more empowering and accountable through our process of
          experimentation.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, at the core of our vision is governance, so what we are building is never finished; we are only
          constructing the first piece. It is a dynamic effort we hope communities will carry forward in amazing ways,
          we are just providing the first set of tools.

          Creating the Joystream brand proved to be challenging due to its uniqueness and the fact that it is
          continually evolving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did we have to take into account a very wide and diverse user base but also we had to create a brand that
          will be futureproof and flexible enough to cover both the existing and upcoming requirements of the project.

          Joystream branding itself is quite metaphoric and symbolic, often referring to symbolism of ancient
          cities, culture, arts and philosophies.
        </p>
        <p>The challenge was to combine it with very modern and complex technologies.</p>

        <p>
          Our new branding is about finding good balance between a very simplistic tone of communication with the
          symbolism and complexity of modern world problems and technologies.
        </p>
        <p>Our branding uses mosaic, geometrical patterns and shapes combined with explicit colours and symbolic 
      illustrations.</p>
        <p>
          We also deploy descriptive icons in combination with simple glyph style system icons and an experimental 
      illustration style.
