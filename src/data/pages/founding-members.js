    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Term</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      The Joystream Founding Member Program was formally launched during February 2021. The program will stop accepting
      new submissions (activity summaries) and awarding further leaderboard points approximately one month in advance of
      the mainnet launch, on the snapshot date, yet to be confirmed.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      <em>Our current target for mainnet launch is during Q4 2021, though this is subject to change.</em>
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Eligibility</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">The program is open to everyone over the age of 18 who are not U.S. persons. </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      To be formally admitted to the program you will be contacted and screened by a Jsgenesis representative once your
      community contributions have met our internally determined threshold for admission.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      {' '}
      The formal admission of new Founding Members to the program will take place at the end of scoring periods (the
      dates of which are published on our website). Each scoring period currently lasts two weeks.
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Communication</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      We will publish further public updates about the program through our regular communication channels, including our
      Official Discord Channel, the Joystream Newsletter, the official GitHub repo for the program
      (github.com/joystream/founding-members) and on our website (www.joystream.org), and blog (blog.joystream.org).
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      Any private or sensitive information about your participation in the program will be communicated via Keybase or
      some other previously agreed contact method.
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Token Allocation Formula</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      Once officially awarded with Founding Member status, you will be automatically assigned 0.02% of the mainnet
      genesis token supply. The rest of your token allocation will be calculated based on your proportional share of
      leaderboard points among all Founding Members.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      Since the current program provides a token pool of 15%, this 15% will be made up of claims of the default 0.02% by
      each participant, and the remaining allocation not already claimed under this rule will be distributed
      proportionally based on the relative share of total leaderboard points for each Founding Member.
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Reward Policy</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      Points have no intrinsic value and when assigned to users with the Founding Member status they only represent a
      partial claim on an as yet undetermined quantity of mainnet JOY tokens. In the case of bad faith activity (see
      below), leaderboard/founding member points can be voided at any time.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      Participants should also be aware that tokens allocated for mainnet may include some vesting period or "locks",
      that restricts what they can be used for some period of time.
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Eviction Policy</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      Any platform member who participates in fraudulent or bad faith activity is liable to be expelled from the
      leaderboards and Founding Member program, with all associated token claims voided.
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Account and Key Security</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      Your leaderboard/founding member points are yours alone and are non-transferrable. You must keep your account and
      any private keys associated with your membership of the Founding Member program safe and engage in sensible
      digital security practices.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      Keys with associated Founding Member token claims must not be transferred to anyone else under any circumstances.
      Where this occurs, points or token claims may be voided (see above).
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      Tokens can only be allocated to addresses under your control. You may be required to sign a message proving you
      own the private keys to any addresses you provide.
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Activity Reporting</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      You cannot claim for the same activity on more than one occasion (i.e. across more than one summary) in order to
      be awarded the same points twice. If this does occur it is liable to be deemed bad faith and may result in your
      eviction from the program.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      All activity must be reported within 30 days of taking place. Contributions recorded outside of this window will
      not qualify for rewards. For this reason it is very important to submit regular summaries.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      Once you have submitted your activity up to and including a certain date, you can no longer submit activity from
      before this date.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-M">
      When reporting contributions, the correct format for summary submissions should be observed.
    </p>
    <h4 className="margin-bottom-S">Updates To These Rules</h4>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      Jsgenesis reserves the right to update the rules of the program at any time, for any reason.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      If serious flaws in the structure of the program are discovered, Jsgenesis reserves the right to announce that
      after a future scoring period, the "season" is concluded, and a new scheme will apply to following seasons, thus
      resetting "scores". In such an event, a "slice" of the pool, set by Jsgenesis discretion, will be allocated in
      accordance with existing rules. The remainder will be transferred to new "seasons".
    </p>
    <p className="margin-bottom-XS">
      Jsgenesis reserves the right not to honour any aspect of this agreement due to legal considerations.
    </p>
