// React Remark does not support line-through decoration out of the box. To override the limitation use ***text***

const longDescrSample = `
While editing the text user should have a lot of options which basic markdown syntax allows for. *Text can be italic*, **or it can be bolded**, or if something is completed ***it can be striked through***.

## There are H2 headings as well ðŸ«¡

User can use links by enclosing the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

The link should be styled as following: [Hey I'm a link click me](https://www.joystream.org/)

### There are more headings (this one is H3)
Lets look at the **ordered list** of all headings that user can use:

1. H1 by typing *â€˜#â€™* or clicking H1 action button.
2. H2 by typing *â€˜##â€™* or clicking H2 action button.
3. H3 by typing *â€˜###â€™* or clicking H3 action button.
